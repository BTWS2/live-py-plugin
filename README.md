* Set path to preferred python executable and the code_tracer.py script.
* Save and close this pane.

* Open a new window.
* Navigate to Live Coding -> Start
* This should bring up a new pane on the right. You *must* type something into this buffer in order for a tab to be made in the new frame. Still haven't worked this one out yet.
