# Flag Tutorial: Romania to Colombia

Beginning Python programmers can use this tutorial to learn basic concepts in
Python using the visual tools in the turtle module. All the code runs in your
browser, so you don't have to install anything.

The challenge in this tutorial is to learn how this turtle script draws the
Romanian flag on the right, and then change it to draw the Colombian flag shown
as the goal below. You can experiment on your own, or read the rest of the
tutorial to learn the concepts you need. The progress bar shows how close you
are to the goal, and the canvas differences, below right, highlight the
differences in red.

## The Challenge

Change the script to draw the Colombian flag, which is 300 wide and 200 high.
The colors from top to bottom are: `gold`, `firebrick3` are `dodgerblue4`.

## Moving the Turtle

If you haven't used the turtle before, imagine that it's a little turtle in the
middle of a piece of paper with a pen in its mouth. You can tell it to walk
forward and backward or turn left and right. When it walks, it drags the pen
along the paper and draws a line. It always starts in the middle of the page,
facing right.

In this example, it walks forward 100 pixels with `forward()`, turns 90° to the
right using `right()`, then walks forward 50 pixels . Use `left()` if you want
to turn left and `backward()` if you want to go backward. The `done()` call at
the end doesn't do anything here in the browser, but it keeps the turtle window
open, if you copy this script and run it in regular Python. Can you change the
script so that your canvas matches the goal canvas below?

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(50)
    
    t.done()
    ### Goal ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.forward(50)
    t.right(45)
    t.forward(100)

## Debugging with Stamps

Two moves plus a turn are pretty simple to follow, but the scripts will get
longer and more complicated. When you're trying to figure out how a script
works, the `stamp()` method can show you where the turtle is at any point. In
this script, the stamp shows you where the turtle starts. Try cutting that line
and then pasting it after each command in the script. Think about where you
expect the stamp to appear before you paste it in. You can also move the current
line up and down with *Alt+Up* and
*Alt+Down* on most systems or
*Option+Up* and *Option+Down* on a Mac. You can find more shortcuts in
the [Ace editor documentation].

Bonus: If you want to change the shape of the cursor to a turtle,
add `t.shape("turtle")` on the second line in this script.

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.stamp()
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(30)
    t.forward(84)
    t.right(60)
    t.forward(66)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(50)
    t.right(120)
    t.forward(33)
    t.right(150)
    t.forward(16)
    
    t.done()

## Filling Shapes

To draw the flags, you need to fill in blocks of colour, calling `begin_fill()`,
moving the turtle around a shape, and then calling `end_fill()`. Turn this
triangle into a square.

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.begin_fill()
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(120)
    t.forward(100)
    t.end_fill()
    
    t.done()
    ### Goal ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.begin_fill()
    for _ in range(4):
        t.forward(100)
        t.right(90)
    t.end_fill()

If you get stuck with the left side of the square highlighted in red, make sure
you've moved the turtle around all four sides of the square. It makes a small
difference.

## Repeating with Loops

Computers are good at doing the same thing over and over. Drawing a square, for
example, can be done by repeating two commands four times: move forward and turn
90°. One way to repeat commands in Python is to put them in a `for` loop. The
`range()` function produces a range of numbers, and `for i in range(4):` will 
repeat the commands below it 4 times, putting a different number in `i` each 
time. In this example, we don't care about the number in `i`, we just want to 
repeat the movements 4 times. Which lines are inside the loop? Python uses
indentation (a tab or four spaces) to group lines into a loop, so the loop ends
when the indentation comes back to the left.

Try changing this square into a rectangle. As a hint, rectangles are less
repetitive than squares, so your loop will only repeat two times, but it will
have two different forward moves in it.

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)
    
    t.done()
    ### Goal ###
    import turtle as t
    
    for i in range(2):
        t.forward(100)
        t.left(90)
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)

## Lifting the Pen

The turtle doesn't have to draw a line everywhere it moves. Try moving the
`penup()` and `pendown()` calls around in this script to see what changes. Try
adding a `t.stamp()` call.

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.begin_fill()
    for i in range(2):
        t.forward(100)
        t.left(90)
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)
    t.end_fill()
    
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(50)
    t.left(90)
    t.penup()
    t.forward(50)
    t.pendown()
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(50)
        t.right(90)
    
    t.done()

## Changing Colour

The last thing you need to solve this challenge is changing the colour of the
pen with the `color()` command. Can you figure out how to add the gold rectangle
below the blue square?

    ### Canvas ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.color('blue')
    t.begin_fill()
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)
    t.end_fill()
    
    t.done()
    ### Goal ###
    import turtle as t
    
    t.color('blue')
    t.begin_fill()
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)
    t.end_fill()

    t.penup()
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(50)
    t.left(90)
    t.back(50)
    t.pendown()
    t.color('gold')
    t.begin_fill()
    for i in range(2):
        t.forward(100)
        t.right(90)
        t.forward(50)
        t.right(90)
    t.end_fill()
