# Live Lessons for Matplotlib

This folder used to hold lesson files for Matplotlib lessons with live feedback.
This was originally planned as a PyCharm feature, but it is now in the
[browser version]. The Matplotlib lessons from this folder moved to the
[Matplotlib introduction].

[browser version]: https://donkirkby.github.io/live-py-plugin/demo/
[Matplotlib introduction]: https://donkirkby.github.io/live-py-plugin/demo/matplotlib/intro
